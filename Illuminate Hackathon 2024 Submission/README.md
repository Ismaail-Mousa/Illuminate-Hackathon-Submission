This is Integral Run!

A game designed to help provide easy access to education widespread in multiple ways, and represents a way that eduction programs and can be made in the future.

Once you run the program, operate the blue cube, known as your "adventurer" with the arrow keys. Be sure not to cross the red border or collide with the red blocks (known as "death blocks")

These death blocks take away your points, but you can gain these points back!

Every once and a while, integrals spawn out of nowhere, allowing you to increase your points by 100 if you evaluate it correctly.

However, if you don't, then the game will spawn more death blocks!

You can exit the game simply by clicking "Cancel" whenever an integral appears and then clicking the "x" at the top right corner.

Good luck!
